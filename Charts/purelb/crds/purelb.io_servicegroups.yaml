                  fields are a legacy from the pre-dualStack days when a service could
                  have only one IP address. If you're running a single-stack environment
                  then they're still valid, but V4Pool and V6Pool are preferred. The
                  V4Pool and V6Pool fields allow you to configure pools of both IPV4
                  and IPV6 addresses to support dual-stack and you can also use them
                  in a single-stack environment."
