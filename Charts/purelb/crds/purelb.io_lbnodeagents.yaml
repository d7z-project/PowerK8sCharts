                  LocalInterface is unimplemented but will be optional. If it is not
                  provided then the agents will add the service address to whichever
                  interface carries the default route. ExtLBInterface is also unimplemented.

                      but the default is "default" which will make PureLB use the
                      interface that has the default route, which works in most cases.
